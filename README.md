# HistoPathNCA_pipeline
A nuclear and cell annotation pipeline for histopathology H&amp;E slides using CellProfiler.

This pipeline was developed using the publicly available CellProfiler (Carpenter AE et al. CellProfiler: image analysis software for identifying and 
quantifying cell phenotypes. Genome Biology, 2006) software to perform nuclear and cell annotation from melanoma histopathology slides. 

CellProfiler 3.1.8 version is used.
